Description: p2p microblogging
 twister is an experimental peer-to-peer microblogging software.
 User registration and authentication is provided by a bitcoin-like network,
 so it is completely distributed (does not depend on any central authority).
 Post distribution uses kademlia DHT network and bittorrent-like swarms,
 both are provided by libtorrent.
